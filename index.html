      <h2>About leopard geckos</h2>
    </header>
    <p>Common leopard geckos are one of the most popular lizard pets. They are possibly the first domesticated lizard species. Their small size, robustness, and relatively easy care makes them a good "beginner" reptile pet. They breed easily in captivity, so most sold today are captive-bred rather than wild-caught.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Terrarium</li>
          <p>
            You’ll want to keep your leopard gecko in a well-ventilated terrarium with a screened lid. Start with a ten gallon tank. If you’re getting three geckos, think about increasing your tank size.
          </p>
        <li>Temperature and humidity</li>
          <p>
            Keep your leopard gecko’s habitat toasty, like the warm climate he comes from. You should have a warm side and a cool side of the tank, and let him decide the area he likes best. To do this, put a heat light on one side of the habitat, and measure the temperature with a thermometer at each end. <code>You’re aiming to keep the terrarium between 85 and 95 degrees F (29 to 35 C) on the warm end,</code> and ten degrees lower on the cool side. It’s also worth getting a hygrometer, to make sure humidity remains in that 10% to 30% range, which geckos prefer.
          </p>
        <li>Lighting</li>
          <p>
            <code>Geckos require 12 hours of visible light a day.</code> If you want to see what they do under cover of darkness, pick up a night-specific bulb. Then you can see what your reptile pals are up to without disorienting them with a bright light at night.

      <h2>which kind of insects to feed?</h2>
    </header>
    <p>The best insects to feed your Leopard Gecko are <code>crickets and mealworms.</code> However, you can also feed him waxworms, butterworms, silkworms, tomato hornworms, beetles, sow bugs and cockroaches. Waxworms and superworms should be fed as a treat as they're high in fat.</p>

      <h2>How can i keep my leopard gecko healthy</h2>
    </header>
    <p>It’s a good idea to have a veterinarian examine your leopard geckos shortly after you get them. When you first bring them home, <code>don’t handle your new leopard geckos for three or four days—they need to get used to their new surroundings.</code> Keep a close eye on them, in case moving in has stressed them out or caused them to get sick. Even a settled-in lizard can get sick. It’s probably a good time for a check-up at the vet if you notice these symptoms:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Hiding more than usual</li>
      <li>Eating or drinking less; even losing weight</li>
      <li>Swollen joints</li>
      <li>Discharge from the eyes, nose or mouth</li>
      <li>Discolored skin and noticeable shedding problems</li>
      <li>Droppings that are runny for more than two days</li>
    </ul>
